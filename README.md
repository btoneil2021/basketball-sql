Databases Final Project

- Condensed is FAKE. Normal is the real one
- College Extraction Test is Ben trying to see if he can map two different websites together

TO-DO (for Ben at least)
- Scrape College Data from that one site I found
- Finish functions for Player and College Tables
- (Maybe?) Consense the program so it doesn't take a million years to run
- Figure out what's needed and what isn't so I don't have to do as much work
